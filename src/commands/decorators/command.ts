/**
 * This decorator does some very handy things, it:
 *
 * - Wraps the command in a try/catch block to prevent most errors from crashing the process.
 * 	- Please use CmdRequirementError class when throwing errors to do with user-related faults. This will reduce console error pollution.
 * - Sorts out permissions.
 * - Lets you define "must-haves" before the command is even run.
 * - Will automatically invoke subcommands if found in this object. The name of the subcommand must match the name of the method in this object.
 * 	- Of course, reserved JavaScript keywords cannot be used. :( You might need to get creative.
 * - Can help you out with permissions.
 * By default a user must have speak permissions to interact with the bot but that can be overridden.
