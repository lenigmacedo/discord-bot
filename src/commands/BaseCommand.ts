	 * - The first letter of the filename and classname of the command MUST be uppercase as per convention, but the slash command registration can stay lowercase.

	 * Remarks:
	 * - Please see https://discordjs.guide/interactions/registering-slash-commands.html#guild-commands for more info about slash commands.
